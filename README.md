# QKD
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) or NTRU key. 
If converting each IP address to a unique binary value, 
then to a hexadecimal value, and finally use this as a unique identifier to associate with a specific QKD or NTRU key.  
and "never trust the client"


examples:

from MyLibrary import ip_to_bin, bin_to_hex, associate_key, get_key

# Use the functions
ip_bin = ip_to_bin("192.168.1.1")
Without these lines in __init__.py, you would need to import them as follows:

python
from MyLibrary.ip_conv import ip_to_bin, bin_to_hex
from MyLibrary.key_mng import associate_key, get_key

# Use the functions
ip_bin = ip_to_bin("192.168.1.1") and where do they go


example usage of the functions ip_to_bin, bin_to_hex, associate_key, and get_key from your MyLibrary package. 
This is not a part of the package itself, 
but rather it's an example of how a user might use your package in their own Python scripts or projects.

These examples would generally not be included directly within the package's files. 
Instead, you might want to include examples like this in your package's documentation, 
in an examples directory in your repository, or in a README.md file. 
The purpose of these examples is to demonstrate how to use your package, 
so they should be easily accessible and understandable to potential users.

It's also worth noting that you should replace MyLibrary with the actual name of your package. 
If your package is named qkd, you would replace MyLibrary with qkd in the example scripts./


python
Copy code
# Import the necessary functions from your library
from qkd import create_qkd_key, encrypt_data, decrypt_data

# Create a QKD key
key = create_qkd_key()

# Encrypt some data with the key
plaintext = "This is some data to encrypt"
ciphertext = encrypt_data(plaintext, key)

# Now the 'ciphertext' variable contains the encrypted data

# If you want to decrypt the data later, you can use the same key
decrypted_text = decrypt_data(ciphertext, key)

# Now the 'decrypted_text' variable should be the same as the original 'plaintext'
As for converting IP addresses into unique binary or hexadecimal identifiers and then associating them with specific keys, that could look something like this:

python
Copy code
from qkd import create_qkd_key
from MyLibrary.ip_conv import ip_to_bin, bin_to_hex
from MyLibrary.key_mng import associate_key, get_key

# Convert the IP address to binary
ip_bin = ip_to_bin("192.168.1.1")

# Convert the binary to hex
ip_hex = bin_to_hex(ip_bin)

# Create a new QKD key
key = create_qkd_key()

# Associate the hex value with the key
associate_key(ip_hex, key)

# Later, if you want to retrieve the key associated with an IP address:
ip_bin = ip_to_bin("192.168.1.1")
ip_hex = bin_to_hex(ip_bin)
key = get_key(ip_hex)
